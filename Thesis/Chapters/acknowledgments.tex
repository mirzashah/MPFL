I would like to thank all those that made this work possible. My advisor and committee head, Dr. John Hannan, whose tireless guidance and understanding of programming language theory was crucial to the completion of this thesis. My other committee member, Dr. Mahmut Kandemir. My colleague, mentor, and friend, Mr. Matthew Davis, for all the conversations we had over the years regarding the topics in the thesis and his impeccable and thorough proofreading of several drafts. My manager at Penn State's Applied Research Lab, Dr. Jeff Weinschenk, who suggested the research topic and also helped proofread the thesis. I would like to acknowledge my close friends Deepak, Vivek, Ross, Tom, and Alex whom unknowingly helped and inspired me over the years with our late night debates and conversations regarding computation, artificial intelligence, psychology, economics, philosophy, and countless other topics. Finally, I would like to thank my lovely sister, Alvira, whom perpetually pestered me (in a good way) until I completed this thesis.
