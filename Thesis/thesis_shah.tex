\include{./Chapters/abstract}

%% this is the end of the abstract

%% after the abstract come the table of contents, the list of tables,
%% and the list of figures
%% Note about the figure list... so the figure list is a decent length,
%% use the following command for the figure captions:
%% \caption[Short figure title to appear in figure list]{Normal figure caption}
%% (this trick unfortunately does not work with the deluxetable 
%% ``\tablecaption'' command, so be careful what you put in the table captions)
%%
%% If you have really long tables that cover multiple pages, you
%% will want to use the ``longtable'' environment (it is very similer to
%% deluxetable) but allows you to specify headers and footers for the first,
%% last, and middle pages of the figure.

%% use this command to omit the list of tables,
%% if the thesis doesn't contain any tables
%\nolotables

%% use this command to omit the list of figures,

%% this is the end of the front matter

%% now we include the actual chapters of the thesis
%% there are individual chapter files ch-intr.tex, ch-over.tex, ...
%% (NOTE: you do not need the ``.tex'' extention on the file name 
%% in the include statement)
%% these chapters can be in a sub-directory, for example: 
%% \include{chapterdirectory/chaptername}

\include{./Chapters/chapter1}

\include{./Chapters/chapter2}

\include{./Chapters/chapter3}

\include{./Chapters/chapter4}

\include{./Chapters/chapter5}

\include{./Chapters/chapter6}

\include{./Chapters/chapter7}

%\include{./Chapters/chapter8}


%\include{conclusions}

%% now we include the appendices
%\appendices
%% omit this if there are no appendices

%% if there is only one appendix, 
%% say \singleappendix instead of \appendices
% \singleappendix

%% these are the actual commands to include the apendix files:

%\include{ap-addi}

%\include{ap-more}


%% finally comes the bibliography and vita
%% the bibliography is generated automatically using BibTeX
%% Note: in order to get the (author year) citation style, this example 
%% includes a different *.bst style file than psuthesis.bst.  Sarah found 
%% this style file on: http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~harza/latex/  
%% This style includes the paper titles in the bibliography, so use it 
%% if you want:
%\bibliographystyle{/enter/path/to/ayphdthesis_mod}
%% However, according to the grad school thesis guide (c.2004), there is no 
%% special formating required for the bibliography, and to just follow 
%% the citation styles of your field, in that case the ``apj'' style is 
%% prefectly OK, so that is the one that is going to be included in this
%% example file (use whichever style you prefer):
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}

%% the following is the path to you *.bib file 
%% (you do not need to enter the ``.bib'' extention)
\bibliography{thesis_shah}
%% ADS can generate the entries in the bib file for you, just call up
%% the abstract, then near the bottom of the abstract page there is a
%% link to ``Bibtex entry for this abstract'' - just copy that into 
%% your bib file.  Here is an example bibtex entry:
%% @ARTICLE{citecode,
%%    author = {{Smith}, J. and {Jones}, M.},
%%     title = "{This Paper has some Really Cool Results}",
%%   journal = {\aj},
%%      year = 2002,
%%     month = sep,
%%    volume = 123,
%%     pages = {1-20},
%%    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.1S&amp;db_key=AST},
%%   adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}
%% }
%% NOTE: ADS returns the AASTeX code for the journal name, you'll either 
%% have to change that by hand in each bib entry, or include a 
%% definition of the codes in your ``definitions'' file so LaTeX doesn't 
%% freak out.  Also, what I entered as ``citecode'' can be changed to 
%% whatever you want to use in the citations in the document, i.e., for
%% ``\citet{citecode}'' or ``\citep{citecode}''.


%% the thesis must end with a Curriculum Vitae (**one page or less**)

This research involved the development of a domain-specific programming language for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This language allows users of AUVs to specify missions in a very high level language and have a virtual machine process that specification and develop a plan to accomplish it. The virtual machine can dynamically replan the missions as necessary to accomplish the goals specified. The language semantics are customizable through a modular, component development system via a well-defined application programmer interface (API).
